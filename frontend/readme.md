## Description
**Fronted**: I have builded website with basic HTML/CSS and some JS, i dont build it with **ReactJS** cuz i'm not good at Frontend, but i use template engines - PUG, in my course i dont spend time so much to frontend, i will imporve it later.

**Backend**: I have installed framework expressJS for build server http on nodejs environment, i dont use database, i created file with name joke.model.js has *array to archive data*, i want to deploy it heroku so i dont want to use DTB for archive, you can check the change of the data fields by looking at the terminal.

**How to solve?**: I have 2 pj in 1 github, you can check oldversion at 
4th in commits, this pj i have used cookie but i really not understand the problem so i solved it with POST method. And 5th in commits i change it, use js with document.cookie for write cookie and use it for track vote of user and send value to backend (midlleware to handle it)

*1/3/2022: issue: with end of jokes, it not smooth to change content*
